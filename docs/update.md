# Release Notes

v2.17.0 (December 13th 2025)
===

Hi everyone,

This week, an update to D&D Beyond's website broke our ability to roll using Digital Dice. This update fixes that, as well as many other fixes and additional support for special class features.

You can read the full [Changelog](/Changelog#v2170) to see all the changes included in this release.

A big thank you to [@dmportella](https://github.com/dmportella) for making this release, as well as to my generous [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters. 

This is also the perfect moment to wish everyone happy holidays, and a happy new year!

Enjoy!
