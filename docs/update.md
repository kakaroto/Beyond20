# Release Notes

v2.17.1 (January 16th 2026)
===

Hi everyone,

I hope everyone managed to get some rest during the holidays, enough rest at least to face what 2026 has brought upon us already.

Today, we're releasing a small bugfix release which fixes an issue on the Chrome browser since its latest version update, which prevented rolling digital dice and processing monster stat blocks.

We've also fixed a bug which caused the Confusion spell not to display to VTT and differentiating between the 2014 and 2024 versions of the Cleric's Blessed Strikes.

You can read the full [Changelog](/Changelog#v2171) to see all the changes included in this release.

As usual, a big thank you to [@dmportella](https://github.com/dmportella) for his work, as well as to my generous [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters. 

Enjoy!

Hi everyone,

This week, an update to D&D Beyond's website broke our ability to roll using Digital Dice. This update fixes that, as well as many other fixes and additional support for special class features.

You can read the full [Changelog](/Changelog#v2170) to see all the changes included in this release.

A big thank you to [@dmportella](https://github.com/dmportella) for making this release, as well as to my generous [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters. 

This is also the perfect moment to wish everyone happy holidays, and a happy new year!

Enjoy!
